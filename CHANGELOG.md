## [1.4.4] - 2025-08-29

### üöÄ Built-in Tools Integration & Reliability Improvements

### Added
- Built-in tools are now passed to the LLM as callable tools (not just documented in the prompt), ensuring the model can actually invoke them.
- Clear usage examples for common tools (write_file, read_file, list_directory) in the system prompt.
- Strong JSON argument formatting guidance in the system prompt to prevent concatenated JSON objects.

### Fixed
- Tool call argument parsing errors caused by concatenated JSON strings (e.g., `{...}{...}`) now log diagnostic info and safely fall back to `{}` while guidance reduces occurrence.
- Improved tool result formatting for built-in tools so arrays and objects display as readable content rather than `[Array]`/`[Object]`.
- Debug logs now accurately report counts of built-in vs MCP vs control tools at each turn.

### Changed
- Enhanced system prompt with explicit rules: "Tool arguments MUST be a single valid JSON object" and examples of correct vs incorrect usage.
