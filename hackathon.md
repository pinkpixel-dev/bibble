Code isn’t just for solving problems. It’s also for exploring ideas, expressing creativity, and building something just because it sparks joy.

For the Love of Code is a global, summer-long hackathon for developers of all experience levels to build the project they’ve been thinking about but haven’t had a reason to start. Whether it’s a web app, CLI tool, game, AI exploration, or a creative experiment, this is your invitation to build for the fun of it — solo, with friends, or alongside GitHub Copilot.

When
For the Love of Code will run from July 16 to September 22, 2025.

What you could win

Internet immortality: Top entries will be featured on the GitHub blog
12 months of GitHub Copilot Pro+ for winners in each category
Glory, vibes, and an excellent excuse to finally build that thing
The real prize is working on something you love.

What can you build?
Anything you want! We’ll be picking winners in six highly scientific categories. Each one is outlined below with inspiration to spark ideas and nerd-snipe you into action 🎯

Category 1: Buttons, beeps, and blinkenlights

An illustration of a retro computer screen with Mona walking acrossIf it lights up, makes noise, or looks like it escaped from a 1998 RadioShack, it belongs here. Hardware hacks (real or simulated) that blink, beep, buzz, or surprise. Think interactive, physical, tactile, and just a little chaotic. Examples:

A traffic light that displays your build status
A soldered-together sidekick that yells “LGTM!” every time your tests pass
An e-ink screen displaying your contribution graph – oops, this has already shipped!
A hack to make your screen display actual work when the webcam detects your boss approaching
A laptop opening and closing-powered morse code generator
A Rust project that visualizes guitar notes on an ESP32 T-Display ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬
Category 2: Agents of change

An illustration GitHub Copilot with one of their eyes replaced with a heartAI-powered experiences, agents, or old-fashioned bots that help, hinder, or hilariously misunderstand you. Whether it’s helping automate workflows, critiquing your code like a judgmental coworker, or pretending to be your sentient toaster, this is your playground for all things assistant-y and absurd. Examples:

An LLM-powered changelog writer that wildly over-dramatizes every update. “Fixed minor bug” → “Vanquished a lurking menace that corrupted the sacred login flow.”
An agent that reviews PRs like a sarcastic senior dev, an overly nice intern, or a concerned parent: “Are you sure this function needs to be this recursive?”
An AI-assisted app to help split your restaurant bills
A Shania Twain Slack or Discord bot to inspire (Editor’s note: That don’t impress me much!)
Category 3: Terminal talent

An illustration of a terminal with a familiar duck characterCommand-line tools, extensions, and TUI projects that are clever, useful, or just plain fun. Serious utilities with personality, beautifully crafted interfaces, or quirky scripts that make your terminal feel more alive all belong here. If it runs in the shell and makes you smile, it belongs here. Examples:

A command-line karaoke machine.
A GitHub CLI extension that gives your daily horoscope and outlook based on issues and pull requests.
An interactive tool to automate that one thing that you’ve been meaning to automate for years.
An animated party parrot for your terminal
A mechanical keyboard sound simulator
Category 4: Game on

An illustration of a blocktacular arcade cabinet of some sort... that kinda resembles HubotCode is your controller. Build something playable, puzzling, or just plain fun. This category is for interactive experiences of all kinds, like prototyping a game idea, remixing mechanics, or mashing up genres. Think nostalgic, clever, or completely original. Fun first, functional close behind. Examples:

A retro-style arcade game inspired by the classics you grew up playing.
An adventure game with AI-generated plot twists, NPCs, and side quests.
A vibe-coded vertical jumper built with and featuring your favorite Copilot.
Yet another Flappy Bird clone, but with Octocats
A vertical scroller where you fall through real lines of GitHub code
Category 5: World wide wonders

Whether it’s your first HTML experiment, a polished tool you’ve been meaning to ship, or a playful side project that does something surprisingly useful, this is your space. Educational, delightful, impressive, or just plain fun, all kinds of web builds are welcome. Examples:

A web app that takes a GitHub username and roasts them based on their contributions, commit messages, and questionable emoji use 🪄 📟 🦴 💾 🫠.
A nostalgic 90s-style site that loads like it’s on dial-up, complete with pixel art loading bars, pop-up ads, a guestbook, and that dancing baby GIF.
A CAPTCHA that requires you to kill baddies in Doom
An an interactive, randomized retro sci-fi dashboard with an alien aesthetic Qapla’
Category 6: Everything but the kitchen sink

An illustration of a retro computer screen featuring a joker cardToo niche? Too specific? Hard to categorize? Perfect. This is your wild card category for all the creative projects that don’t fit neatly anywhere else. Think extensions, plugins, tools, GitHub Actions, or prototypes that turned into something unexpectedly useful. Practical, playful, or just uniquely yours, we want to see it all. Examples:

A Git hook that plays sitcom laugh tracks when you commit. 
A VS Code extension that gives your functions Yelp-style reviews.
A GitHub Action that refuses to deploy if your team hasn’t merged a PR with a positive emoji in the title that week.
A rewrite of something in Rust for the sake of it.
A VS Code extension to bring pets into your editor
YOUR AMAZING IDEA GOES HERE!
Make it wildly useful, or just plain weird. As long as it brings you joy.

Not sure where to start? Ask GitHub Copilot!
You don’t have to build alone.

GitHub Copilot isn’t just for autocomplete, it’s a creative partner that can riff with you, brainstorm ideas, explain what your code is actually doing, and more. Ask it things like:

“Give me five fun and creative coding projects I can complete in a weekend.”

“Help me create a Git hook that plays sitcom laugh tracks when you commit.”

And if you want to take it further…

We may feature standout projects that make especially creative use of Copilot, including Agent mode. It’s not required for participation, but we’ll definitely be keeping an eye out.

Copilot can’t wait to get started with you! <3

Who can participate?

Students, maintainers, weekend tinkerers, creative coders, salty seasoned pros, and curious beginners. Solo or squad. First-timer or frequent flyer. If you write code…or want to… it’s for you.

How to join

Spend an afternoon or the whole summer. Build something joyful: solo, with friends, or with Copilot.
Push your code to a public GitHub repository by 11:59 p.m. Anywhere on Earth (AoE)* on September 22, 2025*.
Submit your entries via the official submission form.
* Editor’s note: We suspect Lee picked this deadline to avoid doing time zone math, and so he’d never have to explain daylight saving time again. Respect.

Tag your progress with #ForTheLoveOfCode and we’ll feature our favorites on social and GitHub Explore page!

Rules
The short and sweet version:

The use of open source is encouraged!
The use of GitHub Copilot is encouraged, but optional.
Submit up to 42 projects. (Don’t ask why. You know why.)
Your project must be in a public GitHub repo with a clear README.
Please see complete terms and conditions.

We know… “terms and conditions” sounds like the least fun part of a joyful code challenge. But if you’re submitting a project or hoping for a prize, take a second to read the official rules. Future-you will thank you.

We’re building a space that’s creative, collaborative, and welcoming to all. Please be excellent to each other. See our Code of Conduct.

Judging

A panel of GitHub Stars, Campus Experts, and staff will evaluate entries based on joyfulness, execution, technical difficulty, ingenuity, and relevance to the category. Bonus points (figuratively) for unexpected use of GitHub Copilot.

We’ll pick three winners from each category and announce the winners by October 22, 2025 on the GitHub blog. But honestly? If it makes you smile, you’ve already won.
