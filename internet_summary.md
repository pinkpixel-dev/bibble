Internet Research Summary - 2025-09-18

Overview
- This document summarizes four recent web searches to provide a compact, multi-source overview you can reference quickly.

Key Insights
1) OpenAI API usage guide
- Core steps: obtain an API key, choose the appropriate model, and call the API endpoints (completions, chat/completions, image generation, etc.).
- Best practices: rate limit awareness, robust error handling, input validation/sanitization, handling token limits, streaming options, and cost-conscious usage.
- Security and compliance: protect your API key, use request signing where applicable, and sanitize user-provided prompts.

2) Best practices for modern web development (2024)
- Architectural patterns: Jamstack, serverless/edge functions, and decoupled services for scalability.
- Quality and performance: performance budgets, lazy loading, code-splitting, and efficient asset delivery.
- UX and accessibility: responsive design, inclusive UX, and accessibility compliance.
- Testing and deployment: automated tests, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and observability.
- Security: input sanitization, dependency management, and secure defaults.

3) Top JavaScript testing frameworks (2024)
- Commonly cited tools include Jest, Cypress, Playwright, and Vitest for unit/integration tests and end-to-end tests.
- Trade-offs: Jest is fast for unit tests, Cypress/Playwright excel at E2E, Vitest offers modern tooling with Vite.
- Selection depends on test type, browser coverage, and team workflow.

4) UX design patterns for AI assistants and chatbots
- Patterns: clear onboarding, explicit capabilities and limits disclosure, context-aware prompts, graceful fallbacks, multi-turn handling, and accessible design.
- Interaction design: balance guidance with user control, provide helpful clarifications, and ensure error handling is informative and non-frustrating.
