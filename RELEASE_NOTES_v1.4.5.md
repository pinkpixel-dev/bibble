*Released: August 29, 2025*

## üßπ **Cleanup & JSON Parsing Fixes Release**

Version 1.4.5 delivers **critical stability improvements** that eliminate frustrating JSON parsing errors and provide a much cleaner, more professional chat experience. This release focuses on reliability and user experience enhancements.

---

## üéØ **Key Highlights**

### ‚ú® **No More JSON Parsing Errors!**
The most common source of tool call failures has been **completely eliminated**. Multi-tool calls now work flawlessly without concatenated JSON errors.

### üßπ **Clean Professional Interface** 
Debug clutter is gone! Chat sessions now show clean, professional output without development noise.

### üîå **Better MCP Server Visibility**
All MCP servers now consistently show their connection status at startup, so you always know what tools are available.

---

## üîß **Critical Fixes**

### **JSON Parsing Errors - RESOLVED** üõ†Ô∏è
- **Fixed**: Tool call argument parsing errors caused by concatenated JSON objects
- **Problem**: Multiple tool calls resulted in malformed JSON like `{"path": "..."}{"content": "..."}`
- **Solution**: Implemented proper multi-tool call handling using Map-based tracking by tool call index
- **Impact**: Tool calls now work reliably with multiple simultaneous operations

### **Debug Output Cleanup** üßΩ
- **Removed**: All `[CHAT DEBUG]` messages cluttering the terminal
- **Removed**: `[DEBUG]` tool argument parsing messages  
- **Removed**: Verbose tool call logging on every execution
- **Result**: Chat interface now shows clean, professional output

### **MCP Server Connection Logging** üîå
- **Improved**: Server connection status messages are now more accurate
- **Changed**: From "running on stdio" to "connected successfully" for all transport types
- **Fixed**: All MCP servers now consistently show their startup status
- **Benefit**: Users can clearly see which tools are available at startup

---

## ‚ö° **Performance & Reliability**

### **Enhanced Error Handling**
- JSON parsing now gracefully falls back to empty object `{}` on parse errors
- Improved tool call processing efficiency with better error recovery
- More robust handling of OpenAI streaming with multiple concurrent tool calls

### **Build System Improvements**  
- Updated build configuration to include missing `zod-to-json-schema` external dependency
- Resolved build stability issues for development and production environments

---

## üéÅ **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before v1.4.5:**
```
[CHAT DEBUG] Processing tool call arguments: {...}
[DEBUG] Parsing tool arguments...
Error: Unexpected token '{' in JSON at position 25
Context7 Documentation MCP Server running on stdio
datetime MCP server running on stdio
web-scout MCP server running on stdio  // ‚ùå Sometimes missing
```

### **After v1.4.5:**
```
Context7 Documentation MCP Server connected successfully
DateTime MCP server connected successfully  
web-scout MCP server connected successfully  // ‚úÖ Always shows
MCPollinations MCP server connected successfully

// Clean chat with no debug noise! ‚ú®
```
